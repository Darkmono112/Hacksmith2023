### Review 

## What was done 
- Created mockups for different views
- Made decisions on what type of app we are making
- Decided on a database schema
- Planned out the ways users will interact with the app
- Decided how we will work on and format our code, such as not using Docker and using a linter

## Demo 
    - Present HighLevelDesign.md
    - Present LowLevelDesign.md

## Issues 
    - Blurring the lines between high and low level
    - Didn't have time to plan things as deeply as we would have liked due to an uneven distribution of work due to a teammate's absence
    - Difficulty finding meeting times outside of class that works for everyone

## Resolutions
    - Finding a meeting time that works for as many people as possible
    - Understanding what the sprint requirements are before diving in
    - Clear distribution of work and goals for each team member
