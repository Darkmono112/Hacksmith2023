## Sprint Difficulties:
**Problem:** 
We discovered that Django had a built in testing framework that would automatically create unit tests to test our models and views, but the documentation was confusing and it was difficult to get it configured. Initially, Rob throught it would be quick and easy to get set up, but it ended up having issue after issue

**Resolution:** 
Zane jumped in and helped get everything configured. It took a few days to get the issues worked out, but in the end the tests were created and the framework helped us get it done faster and made sure we didn't miss anything.

**Problem:**
The biggest problem this sprint was probably schedule conflicts. We weren't able to meet with everyone at any given time and we all have a lot of other final projects, assignments, and final exams we're working on, on top of our every day lives. 

**Resolution:**
Paige and Porter created stories so we could grab tasks without having to have a meeting to decide who was doing what. We also communicated well over our group chat when we came across bugs in our testing. Some of us weren't able to do as much work as others, so we distributed the work across who could handle it, and got everything done in a timely manner.
